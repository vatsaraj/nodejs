To run the code in this folder, you'll need to install some dependencies, using
the Node Package Manager commandline (npm).
The dependencies are listed in the file package.json under the heading that
looks like
  "dependencies": {

Dependencies may be installed via npm like this
  npm install express --save
  npm install express3-handlebars --save
  
The --save option saves the dependency and it's relevant version into
package.json

The web server is executed by running the command
  node server.js

Upon starting, the web server will emit a message to let you know the hostname
and port to be used to access the main URL, like
  Navigate to http://<your server name>:8080

If <your server name> is 'localhost' or empty or you are unable to get to that
URL, then try figuring out what the IP address of your server is and then try
navigating to the URL
  http://<your server IP address>:8080
